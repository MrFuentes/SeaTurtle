SEATURTLE(1)                                  General Commands Manual                                 SEATURTLE(1)

NAME
       SeaTurtle - A simple shell built in python3.7.2

SYNOPSIS
       python3 myshell.py [file]

DESCRIPTION
       SeaTurtle  is  a simple command line shell written in Python3.7.2, which also has functionality allowing it
       to execute batch commands. It features a number of built-in commands as well as being compatible  with  all
       other UNIX commands, provided they are installed.

USAGE
   Options
       [file] Executes the commands in the file and then exits the shell.

   Shell Commands
       dir [path/to/directory|< filename] [> filename|>> filename]

              Returns  the  contents  of  the  given  directory, or prints the current directory if no argument is
              given.

       clr

              Clears the terminal

       echo comment|< filename [> filename|>> filename]

              Prints the comment back out to the terminal.

       cd [path/to/directory|< filename]

              Changes the current directory to the given one, or displays the current path if none is given.

       environ [> filename|>> filename]

              Returns all environment variables and their respective values.

       pause

              Pauses use of the shell until the return key is pressed.

       quit

              Closes the shell

   Subprocesses
       Process [< filename] [> filename|>> filename] [&]

              If the given command is not a built-in function of the  shell,  it  will  be  executed  as  a  child
              process, for example python3 foo.py is perfectly valid and will execute as normal.

              Using  & at the end of the line will cause the process to be forked and the shell will return to the
              prompt after executing said process.

   I/O Redirection
       command < <filename>

              Uses the given file as input for the command.

       command >> <filename>

              Appends the output of the command to the given file.

       command > <filename>

              Overwrites data in the given file with the output of the command.
